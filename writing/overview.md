I want to share some insights about my GitHub repository [dynamic-hierarchies-international](https://github.com/justin-napolitano/dynamic-hierarchies-international). This project dives deep into the dynamics of hierarchies within international institutions—a crucial area of study that reflects how power structures operate globally.

## What’s This Repo About?

At its core, this repo contains research that discusses the ins and outs of hierarchical frameworks in global governance. Hierarchies can dictate everything from decision-making processes to power distribution in international organizations. I wanted to explore these themes in a structured, analytical way.

The most significant artifact here is a comprehensive document that synthesizes both theoretical and empirical perspectives on these dynamics. I aimed to bridge the gap between abstract theory and real-world applicability, which is no small feat.

## Why Does It Exist?

I created this repository to do a couple of things:

- Bring attention to the often-overlooked power dynamics in international settings.
- Provide a basis for further research and analysis in the field of global governance.

International organizations play a critical role in world affairs, and understanding how hierarchies work within them can shed light on their effectiveness, legitimacy, and ability to respond to global challenges.

## Key Design Decisions

I made some conscious choices in designing this repository:

- **Focus on Research Documentation**: There are no executable code components in this repo. The emphasis is solely on documenting research. I figured this approach keeps things simple and focused.
  
- **Single Document Structure**: The main content is encapsulated in a single `.docx` file, making it straightforward for anyone interested to dive right into it. This decision optimizes for accessibility over complexity.

- **Supplementary Materials**: I included a directory for supplementary files, which might contain additional text data related to the research. I assumed this would provide more context and depth, though it's more about gathering all relevant info together.

## Tech Stack and Tools

I should mention that there isn’t much of a tech stack here. This project is primarily a research document. Here’s what’s in the repository:

- **Document**: `DynamicHierarchiesInInternationalInstitutions.docx` - The main research document.
- **Directory**: `/full-txt/` - Presumed related text data files.

You won’t find any code to run or software installations needed. Simply download or clone the repository and open the `.docx` file in Microsoft Word or any compatible word processor.

## Trade-offs

Here are a few trade-offs I encountered:

- **Simplicity vs. Complexity**: I chose to keep the project straightforward, but this means no interactive tools or code examples for users who might prefer hands-on engagement.
  
- **Document Format**: Keeping everything in a `.docx` file might limit accessibility for those who don’t use Microsoft products. Conventions shift, and I'm aware of this.

- **Depth of Analysis**: While the document aims to be comprehensive, it can't cover everything. Given the breadth of the topic, I could only scratch the surface in some areas.

## What I’d Like to Improve Next

I have a few ideas for future work that could enhance this project:

- **Format Conversion**: I’m considering converting the document into more accessible formats like PDF or Markdown. This would help reach a broader audience, especially in today’s flat-file world.

- **Data Structuring**: It’s tempting to extract data from my document for computational analyses. But this isn’t in place yet. Structuring data properly can open new avenues for research.

- **Development of Tools**: I’d love to develop tools or simulations to model the hierarchical dynamics described in the document. Making the research interactive could offer invaluable insights.

- **Repository Summary**: An abstract or summary at the top of the repo would help visitors quickly grasp what this project is about. Clarity matters.

## Stay Updated

I regularly share updates and thoughts on this project on social media platforms, including Mastodon, Bluesky, and Twitter/X. Follow me there if you want to keep in touch or dive deeper into discussions around these dynamics.

That’s the short and sweet of my repository on dynamic hierarchies in international institutions. I hope to expand the work and connect with others interested in this important area. If you have insights or want to collaborate, feel free to reach out!
